HF25_R1,8836.00,test w/o retainer grid or frame,the sample folded into itself towards the spark igniter.
HF25_R2,8836.00,test w/o retainer grid or frame,Sample folded over spark igniter and the sample was ignited upon contact
HF25_R3,8836.00,Test w/o retainer frame or grid,Sample folded up. Consistent with other tests. Spark did not ignite sample upon contact. Sample melted-> bubbled-> then ignited.
HF50_R1,8836.00,without frame or grid,sample shriveled toward center at start of exposure
HF50_R2,8836.00,without frame or grid,sample shriveled toward center at start of exposure; foil folded slightly inwards at end of test
HF50_R3,8836.00,without frame or grid,sample shriveled toward center at start of exposure and directly contacted the spark igniter causing early ignition
HF75_R1,8836.00,test w/o frame or grid,small amount of foil lift
