HF25_R1,10035.02,Dimensions: 100.25 x 100.1 x 3.18 mm,"Sample warped prior to ignition. Some of the sample dripped from the foil pan onto the insulation below, and continued to burn."
HF25_R2,10074.96,Dimensions: 99.95 x 100.8 x 3.01,"Significant dripping of sample, see test picture"
HF25_R3,10281.94,Dimensions: 101.54 x 101.26 x 3.05 mm,"Sample warped prior to ignition and contacted the spark ignitor, causing spike in mass data. Close proximity to spark ignitor likely shortened time to ignition. After ignition some sample spilled out of foil pan and continued burning from lower drip tray. See test pictures. "
HF25_R4,10302.25,Dimensions: 101.53 x 101.47 x 3.04 mm,"Sample warped prior to ignition and contacted the spark ignitor, causing spike in mass data. Close proximity to spark ignitor likely shortened time to ignition. See test pictures. "
HF25_R5,10314.43,Dimensions: 101.60 x 101.52 x 3.10 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample warped and shriveled prior to ignition, then melted into a pool fire after ignition. No dripping from foil pan."
