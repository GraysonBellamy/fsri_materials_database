POST TEST CMT,"A few seconds prior to ignition the laminate inflated, then popped violently, possibly affecting mass data. The flames extinguished within 10 seconds of ignition. The spark ignitor was reinserted, and reignition occurred immediately. Throughout this time, the inflation of the laminate pushed the wire grid upwards, approaching and slightly impacting the spark ignitor. Test ended after 60 minutes, per ASTM criteria. "
