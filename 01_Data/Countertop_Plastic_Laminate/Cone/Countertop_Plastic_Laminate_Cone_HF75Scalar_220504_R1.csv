POST TEST CMT,"A few seconds prior to ignition the laminate inflated, then popped violently, possibly affecting mass data. The flames extinguished within 5 seconds of ignition. The spark ignitor was reinserted, and reignition occurred immediately. Throughout this time, the inflation of the laminate pushed the wire grid upwards, approaching the spark ignitor. "
