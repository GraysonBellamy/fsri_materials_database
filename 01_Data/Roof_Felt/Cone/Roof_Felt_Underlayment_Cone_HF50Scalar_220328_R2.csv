POST TEST CMT,"After ignition an air bubble formed beneath the sample which raised the height of the sample surface. After a few seconds a hole formed in the sample which released the gases in the bubble at high enough velocity to form a horizontal flame that extended beyond the radius of the cone. This lasted less than 5 seconds, then the sample returned to normal burning behavoir. "
