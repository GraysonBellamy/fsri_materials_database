POST TEST CMT,"The sample immediately shriveled towards the edges upon exposure. Ignition occurred along one edge of the sample and did not spread further due to a lack of sample mass to sustain flame travel. A small flame (less than 1 cm tall) returned after end of test, then extinguished during following 2 minutes of additional data collection. "
