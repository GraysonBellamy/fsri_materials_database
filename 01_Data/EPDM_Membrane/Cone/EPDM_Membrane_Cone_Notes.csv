HF25-Frame+Grid_R3,8836.00,Dimensions: 100.10 x 99.83 x 5.94 mm, 
HF25-Frame_R2,8836.00,Dimensions: 99.61 x 99.77 x 5.94 mm,After ignition the sample expanded vertically several centimeters above starting surface height. See test pictures. 
HF25_R1,9929.91,Dimensions: 100.11 x 99.19 x 5.93 mm,"After ignition the sample warped and expanded significantly. Expanded vertically several centimeters and contacted the cone heater, causing spikes in mass data. Expanded horizontally until charred pieces fell out of the foil pan, mostly caught by lower drip tray where it continued to burn. See test pictures. "
HF25_R2,8836.00,test w/o retainer grid or frame,Corner of foil lifted and remained raise for duration of the test.
HF25_R3,8836.00,test w/o retainer grid or frame,Corner lifted with 20 seconds till burn out
HF25_R4,10302.25,Dimensions: 101.53 x 101.47 x 3.04 mm,"Sample warped prior to ignition and contacted the spark ignitor, causing spike in mass data. Close proximity to spark ignitor likely shortened time to ignition. See test pictures. "
HF25_R5,10314.43,Dimensions: 101.60 x 101.52 x 3.10 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample warped and shriveled prior to ignition, then melted into a pool fire after ignition. No dripping from foil pan."
