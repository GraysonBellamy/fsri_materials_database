HF25-Frame+Grid_R4,8836.00,Thickness: 6.05 mm; with frame and grid, 
HF25-Frame+Grid_R5,8836.00,Thickness: 6.05 mm; with frame and grid, 
HF25-Frame_R2,8836.00,Dimensions: 99.61 x 99.77 x 5.94 mm,After ignition the sample expanded vertically several centimeters above starting surface height. See test pictures. 
HF25_R1,9929.91,Dimensions: 100.11 x 99.19 x 5.93 mm,"After ignition the sample warped and expanded significantly. Expanded vertically several centimeters and contacted the cone heater, causing spikes in mass data. Expanded horizontally until charred pieces fell out of the foil pan, mostly caught by lower drip tray where it continued to burn. See test pictures. "
