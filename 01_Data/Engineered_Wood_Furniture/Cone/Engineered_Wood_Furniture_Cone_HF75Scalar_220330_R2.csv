PRE TEST CMT,Dimensions: 101.02 x 100.56 x 13.76
POST TEST CMT,At approximately 11:30 the sample began to crack and warp such that large parts of the sample became elevated. This occurred as the flames began to extinguish at the end of the test. This timing is consistent with deformations observed in the previous replicate and at 50 kW/m^2. See test pictures.
