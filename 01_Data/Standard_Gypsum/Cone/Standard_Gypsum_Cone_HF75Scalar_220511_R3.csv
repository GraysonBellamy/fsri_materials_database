POST TEST CMT,"When the shutter was removed, ignition occurred almost instantaneously along the side of the sample and there was some flame spread across the surface of the sample until the rest of the sample ignited. After the flame self-extinguished, the gypsum paper shriveled and curled and had an orange glow, however the test was ended because there was no longer ignition."
