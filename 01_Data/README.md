# Materials and Products Database
## 01_Data

Raw data generated from each apparatus are included here in plain-text format. The data is organized first by material, next by the short name of test apparatus used, and where applicable additional filtering by test settings.

### material.json

Each material directory contains a json file of the same name as the material. This file links the data stored in the repository as well as data and graphs produced by the accompanying scripts (__02_Scripts__) to the respective landing page for the material on the front-end website.
