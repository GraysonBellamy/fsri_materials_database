HF25_R1,10256.49,Dimensions: 101.65 x 100.90 x 3.09 mm; 60 mm spacing, Self extinguished after full surface burning. Unburned sample remained.
HF25_R2,10224.02,Dimensions: 100.64 x 101.59 x 3.05 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample self extinguished at approximately 6:20 with unburned material remaining. Spark ignitor was reinserted, but sample did not reignite after another 6 minutes."
HF25_R3,9814.85,Dimensions: 98.97 x 99.17 x 3.14 mm; 60 mm spacing,Sample self extinguished at approximately 6 minutes with unburned material remaining.
HF50_R1,10174.41,Dimensions: 101.46 x 100.28 x 3.10 mm; 60 mm spacing,"After ignition, sample expanded in height and shrunk in length and width. See post test pictures."
HF50_R2,9801.98,Dimensions: 99.10 x 98.91 x 3.12 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample shriveled prior to ignition, reducing exposed surface area. Sample expanded in height throughout test, reaching several centemeters above calibrated surface height, thereby increasing incident heat flux."
HF50_R3,9756.40,Dimensions: 98.45 x 99.10 x 3.14 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample shriveled prior to ignition, reducing exposed surface area. Sample expanded in height throughout test, reaching several centemeters above calibrated surface height, thereby increasing incident heat flux. Near end of test sample fell on its side."
HF75_R1,9741.65,Dimensions: 98.49 x 98.91 x 3.13 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample shriveled prior to ignition, reducing exposed surface area. Sample expanded in height throughout test, reaching several centemeters above calibrated surface height, thereby increasing incident heat flux. Near end of test sample fell on its side."
HF75_R2,9768.36,Dimensions: 98.88 x 98.79 x 3.12 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample shriveled prior to ignition, reducing exposed surface area. Sample expanded in height throughout test, reaching several centemeters above calibrated surface height, thereby increasing incident heat flux. Sample fell on its side mid test after becoming unbalanced due to height expansion."
HF75_R3,9776.25,Dimensions: 98.99 x 98.76 x 3.12 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample expanded in height throughout test, reaching several centemeters above calibrated surface height, thereby increasing incident heat flux. "
