PRE TEST CMT,"Sample is an assembly of approximately 1 inch polyurethane foam, topped by 1.75 inch polyester batting, topped by polyester fabric."
POST TEST CMT,"The fabric shrivelled upon heating and impacted the spark ignitor causing a spike in the mass time history data. The sample then retracted away from the spark ignitor prior to ignition due to further pyrolysis and melting of the materials. The foil pan folded upwards slightly after ignition and was impacted by the removal of the spark ignitor causing further disturbances in the mass time history data. The foil pan continue to fold in on itself before end of test."
