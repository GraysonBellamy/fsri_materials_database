PRE TEST CMT,"Sample is an assembly of approximately 1 inch polyurethane foam, topped by 1.75 inch polyester batting, topped by polyester fabric."
POST TEST CMT,"The fabric shrivelled upon heating and impacted the spark ignitor causing a spike in the mass time history data. The sample then retracted away from the spark ignitor prior to ignition due to further pyrolysis and melting of the materials. See test pictures."
