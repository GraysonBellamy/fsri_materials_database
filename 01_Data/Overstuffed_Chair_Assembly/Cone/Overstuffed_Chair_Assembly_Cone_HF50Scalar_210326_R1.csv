PRE TEST CMT,"Sample is an assembly of approximately 1 inch polyurethane foam, topped by 1.75 inch polyester batting, topped by polyester fabric."
POST TEST CMT,"The fabric shrivelled upon heating and impacted the spark ignitor causing a spike in the mass time history data. The sample then retracted away from the spark ignitor prior to ignition due to further pyrolysis and melting of the materials."
