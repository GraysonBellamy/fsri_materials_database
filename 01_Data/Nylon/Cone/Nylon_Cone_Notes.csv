HF25-Frame+Grid_R3,8836.00,Dimensions: 100.10 x 99.83 x 5.94 mm, 
HF25-Frame_R2,8836.00,Dimensions: 99.61 x 99.77 x 5.94 mm,After ignition the sample expanded vertically several centimeters above starting surface height. See test pictures. 
HF25_R1,9949.03,Dimensions: 99.93 x 99.56 x 3.12 mm; 60 mm spacing,Sample did not ignite. Expanded vertically. See post test pictures. 
HF25_R2,9940.07,Dimensions: 99.55 x 99.85 x 3.08 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Prior to ignition, the sample expanded vertically and a single large bubble formed. A small hole opened in the bubble which produced a candle-sized flame. The time to ignition event was recorded when the flame began spreading across the surface of the sample. "
HF25_R3,9985.01,Dimensions: 99.95 x 99.90 x 3.10 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Prior to ignition, the sample expanded vertically and a single large bubble formed. Top of the bubble touched the spark ignitor which immediately created a small hole releasing a candle-sized flame. This flame remained steady for approximately one minute with occassonal bursts as gases released from the bubble. The time to ignition event was recorded when the flame began spreading across the surface of the sample. "
HF25_R4,10298.19,Dimensions: 101.48 x 101.48 x 6.80 mm; 60 mm spacing,Minor sampling dripping from foil pan prior to ignition. Sample expanded vertically after ignition. See test pictures.
HF25_R5,10307.32,Dimensions: 101.60 x 101.45 x 6.70 mm; 60 mm spacing,Sample expanded vertically after ignition. See post test pictures.
HF25_R6,10333.63,Dimensions: 101.99 x 101.32 x 3.11 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Sample warped and shriveled prior to ignition, then melted into a pool fire after ignition. No dripping from foil pan."
