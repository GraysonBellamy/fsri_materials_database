POST TEST CMT,"Prior to ignition, the sample expanded vertically and a single large bubble formed. Top of the bubble touched the spark ignitor which immediately created a small hole releasing a candle-sized flame. This flame remained steady for approximately one minute with occassonal bursts as gases released from the bubble. The time to ignition event was recorded when the flame began spreading across the surface of the sample. "
