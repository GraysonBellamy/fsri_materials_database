POST TEST CMT,"
At start of heat flux exposure the sample corners lifted and curled towards the center. The sample continued to warp, then relaxed as the material started melting. The sample remained as a partially melted mass with less than half of the original exposed surfaced area. Ignition began as a candle sized flame which slowly spread across the sample surface. The time to ignition event was recorded when flames had spread across the majority of the sample area, more than a minute after the initial ignition. By the time of peak heat release rate, the flames had spread across the entire foil pan area. "
